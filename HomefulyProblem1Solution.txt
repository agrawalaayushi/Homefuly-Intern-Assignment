Since there is console.log() method. So output will be visible in the console.
Code will print - 
Output Line 1 - Aurelio De Rosa
Output Line 2 - John Doe

Reason of o/p line 1 - In javascript, it depends on how the function is called not how it is defined.
Here, first we have called getFullName() function,  which is returning this.Fullname. 
"this" keyword referes to the current object. So, It will refer to the current fullname of property of object i.e.  : 'Aurelio De Rosa'

Reason of o/p line 2 - we are storing the getFullname into test variable. Here, getFullname is not representing the function name. It is referring to the global attribute/variable not the local variable.
So, it will print the global variable "fullname = 'John Doe'"
